Documentation
-------------
We use Doxygen to document AGE: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html   
The *configuration* file contains the Doxyfile used to generate html files, and .dox files to describe the classes. All .dox are organised with the same tree structure than the source code in order to be easier to maintain.

> **Note:**
This documentation is also accessible **on our official website** : http://doc.ageproject.fr/namespace_a_g_e.html

#### Create your own documentation with Doxygen
Open a command prompt, then use cd to go into the *\Documentation\configuration* directory:  
<code>cd "path-to-your-folder\GameEngine\Documentation\configuration"</code>.  
Then type <code>doxygen</code> in order to generate all html files.  
The documents will be created in the *Documentation\html* directory. You should start opening the index.html file with your browser.
